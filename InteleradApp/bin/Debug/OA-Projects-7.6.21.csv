For the purposes of this document a Release is defined as a collection of hardware, software, documentation, processes or other components, required to implement one or more approved changes to the EMIP program. Such that the overall service package that includes several interconnected assets with each other to deliver a value to HSS and its constituent end users, is called a release. The contents of each release are managed, tested and deployed as a single entity. This means that a release may include several services, components, and assets. But these parts of the service package are meaningful only if they are served together to the EMIP program. Therefore, a release is managed as a single entity in line with the roles and responsibilities defined in this document.

* DICOM migration will not have completed the required go-live threshold by this date.
* There are R&D items for Clario that won't be resolved by this date that will impede the client's workflow.
* Their RIS vendor is not actively participating in the project and as such we don't have HL7 connectivity yet.
